## Recent Projects  

### üéÆ ARPG Training Project (Personal)  
An ARPG inspired by Lost Ark, developed over ~3 months in my free time.  

Focused on building foundational multiplayer-ready systems using Unreal Engine 5's Gameplay Ability System, Gameplay Effects, and Gameplay Cues.  
Each feature is showcased with one implementation example (player spell, boss swipe, boss jump attack, boss transition).  

**Tools used:** Unreal Engine 5, Rider, Meshy.ai, Mixamo, Blender

### üê∫ Wild (Wild Sheep Studio)  
Ambitious open-world action-adventure game. Worked extensively on camera systems, character controls, animation integration, AI behaviors, and tools for designers, all in a custom engine.  

The last public trailer (2014) still conveys the tone, even though 8 more years of development followed.
